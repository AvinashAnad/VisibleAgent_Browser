# Query Analysis: s8-11dadc27

## Original User Goal

`Compare top 3 Hugging Face text-generation models sorted by likes.`

Session inspected: `s8-11dadc27`

Primary session report:

[visible_browser_replay_report_s8-11dadc27.html](reports/s8-11dadc27/visible_browser_replay_report_s8-11dadc27.html)

## Short Answer

The Browser skill completed through the `a11y` path and the session report records the browser actions, page state, extracted data, and final formatter output.

## Data Source Summary

| Source | Status | Used For Final Table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser | success | Yes |
| Researcher | 0 output(s) | No |
| Distiller | 1 output(s) | Maybe |
| Formatter | 1 output(s) | Yes |

## Planner DAG Observed

| Node | Skill | Status | Success | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n:1 | planner | complete | True | Plan or re-plan the DAG. |
| n:2 | browser | complete | True | Filter by Tasks=Text Generation, Sort=Most Likes; then extract the names, descriptions, and like counts for the top 3 models. |
| n:3 | distiller | complete | True | Extract the model name, description, and like count for each of the top 3 models from the browser output. |
| n:4 | formatter | complete | True | Produce the final user-facing answer. |
| n:5 | critic | complete | True | Evaluate an upstream output. |
| n:6 | session_reporter | complete | True | Write session replay and query analysis artifacts. |

## Browser Attempts

| Node | Status | Path | Turns | Error Code | URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n:2 | complete | a11y | 4 | None | https://huggingface.co/models |

## Importance of a11y

`a11y` means the accessibility-tree layer of the Browser skill. It is cheaper than full vision and is useful for interactive UI controls such as filters, sort menus, tabs, accordions, product links, and forms when those controls are exposed to assistive technology.

For blocked pages, a11y is still useful evidence: it can show that the rendered page is an access-denied, CAPTCHA, login, geo, or rate-limit state rather than a normal product page.

## Did The Four-Layer Cascade Run?

| Layer | Role | Observed Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extract | HTTP/trafilatura page text extraction. | No successful Browser extraction recorded. |
| Deterministic | Known stable CSS selectors, when provided. | No deterministic success recorded. |
| a11y | Playwright accessibility-tree interaction. | Evidence captured. |
| Vision | Screenshot set-of-marks fallback. | No vision evidence recorded. |
| Final Browser State | Browser node outcome. | a11y |

## Browser Layer Trace

- `n:2`: extract attempted -> no useful content extracted -> deterministic skipped/no selectors -> a11y succeeded in 4 turn(s) -> vision not needed

## Final Comparison Table

## Token Usage Capture

Browser a11y/vision turns record per-turn token counts in action/step records. Normal LLM skill calls are tagged with `agent` and `session` and are captured by the gateway ledger exposed at `/v1/cost/by_agent?session=<session-id>`. The session reporter now tries to include that gateway rollup in the cost summary. If the running gateway endpoint returns no rows, the reporter falls back to the local SQLite ledger at `llm_gatewayV9/gateway_v8.db`. If neither source has rows for that session, the summary falls back to node-local cost fields, which are often `0.0` for text skills.

## Orchestrator Constraint

This analysis file is generated through the copied agent's `session_reporter` skill path. The original `S9SharedCode` orchestrator remains untouched.

## Browser Attempts

(none)

## Importance of a11y

`a11y` means the accessibility-tree layer of the Browser skill. It is cheaper than full vision and is useful for interactive UI controls such as filters, sort menus, tabs, accordions, product links, and forms when those controls are exposed to assistive technology.

For blocked pages, a11y is still useful evidence: it can show that the rendered page is an access-denied, CAPTCHA, login, geo, or rate-limit state rather than a normal product page.

## Did The Four-Layer Cascade Run?

No Browser node was used, so the browser cascade did not run.

## Browser Layer Trace

- Browser not used -> cascade did not run -> planner used researcher -> distiller/critic path handled structured extraction -> formatter produced final answer

## Final Comparison Table

| Product | Details |
| --- | --- |
| NTTF (Nettur Technical Training Foundation) | A well-established educational institution known for its formal Precision CNC Machinist programs. It is highly regarded for its industry-aligned curriculum, extensive hands-on laboratory experience, and a strong track record of placement (reported at over 98%). |
| RVM CAD | A prominent private training center specializing in CAD/CAM and CNC/VMC programming. They offer intensive, short-term programs (typically around 30 days) that combine software training (Mastercam, NX CAM) with practical machine operation. They provide 100% placement assistance. |
| Technologics Global Pvt Ltd | This provider focuses on industrial automation, offering CNC programming as part of a broader curriculum. Their model emphasizes real-time industrial projects at factory sites and hands-on practical sessions with placement support. |

## Final Answer

```text
While there are many vocational training providers in Bangalore, comprehensive side-by-side data for five distinct institutes is limited. Based on available information, here are three reputable options for CNC/VMC training in Bangalore:

1. NTTF (Nettur Technical Training Foundation): A well-established educational institution known for its formal Precision CNC Machinist programs. It is highly regarded for its industry-aligned curriculum, extensive hands-on laboratory experience, and a strong track record of placement (reported at over 98%).

2. RVM CAD: A prominent private training center specializing in CAD/CAM and CNC/VMC programming. They offer intensive, short-term programs (typically around 30 days) that combine software training (Mastercam, NX CAM) with practical machine operation. They provide 100% placement assistance.

3. Technologics Global Pvt Ltd: This provider focuses on industrial automation, offering CNC programming as part of a broader curriculum. Their model emphasizes real-time industrial projects at factory sites and hands-on practical sessions with placement support.

Other options in the city often include various private technical academies and government-run Industrial Training Institutes (ITI). When evaluating these, it is recommended to verify specific placement claims and ensure the institute provides sufficient hands-on access to actual CNC/VMC machinery.

## Token Usage Capture

Browser a11y/vision turns record per-turn token counts in action/step records. Normal LLM skill calls are tagged with `agent` and `session` and are captured by the gateway ledger exposed at `/v1/cost/by_agent?session=<session-id>`. The session reporter now tries to include that gateway rollup in the cost summary. If the running gateway endpoint returns no rows, the reporter falls back to the local SQLite ledger at `llm_gatewayV9/gateway_v8.db`. If neither source has rows for that session, the summary falls back to node-local cost fields, which are often `0.0` for text skills.

## Orchestrator Constraint

This analysis file is generated through the copied agent's `session_reporter` skill path. The original `S9SharedCode` orchestrator remains untouched.

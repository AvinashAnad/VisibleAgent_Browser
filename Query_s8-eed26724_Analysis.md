# Query Analysis: s8-eed26724

## Original User Goal

`Compare 3 laptops under ₹80,000.`

Session inspected: `s8-eed26724`

Primary session report:

[visible_browser_replay_report_s8-eed26724.html](reports/s8-eed26724/visible_browser_replay_report_s8-eed26724.html)

## Short Answer

The final answer exists even though the Browser path was `blocked` because `blocked` applies to the Browser node attempt, not to the whole DAG. The run recovered through a planner recovery path and then produced the final answer through downstream skills.

## Data Source Summary

| Source | Status | Used For Final Table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser | failed: interaction_failed | No |
| Researcher | 1 output(s) | Yes |
| Distiller | 1 output(s) | Maybe |
| Formatter | 2 output(s) | Yes |

## Planner DAG Observed

| Node | Skill | Status | Success | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n:1 | planner | complete | True | Plan or re-plan the DAG. |
| n:2 | browser | failed | False | Filter for price range under 80000 INR; extract the top 3 laptops including their model name, processor, RAM, and price. |
| n:3 | distiller | pending | None | Extract structured records for the 3 laptops: model_name, processor, ram, storage, and price. |
| n:4 | formatter | pending | None | Produce the final user-facing answer. |
| n:5 | planner | complete | True | Recovery for n:2 |
| n:6 | researcher | complete | True | What are 3 highly rated laptops available in India under ₹80,000 in 2024, including their key specifications and pros/cons? |
| n:7 | formatter | complete | True | Produce the final user-facing answer. |
| n:8 | session_reporter | complete | True | Write session replay and query analysis artifacts. |

## Browser Attempts

| Node | Status | Path | Turns | Error Code | URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n:2 | failed | blocked | 0 | interaction_failed | https://www.croma.com/computers-tablets/laptops/c/bpc-0015 |

## Importance of a11y

`a11y` means the accessibility-tree layer of the Browser skill. It is cheaper than full vision and is useful for interactive UI controls such as filters, sort menus, tabs, accordions, product links, and forms when those controls are exposed to assistive technology.

For blocked pages, a11y is still useful evidence: it can show that the rendered page is an access-denied, CAPTCHA, login, geo, or rate-limit state rather than a normal product page.

## Did The Four-Layer Cascade Run?

| Layer | Role | Observed Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extract | HTTP/trafilatura page text extraction. | No successful Browser extraction recorded. |
| Deterministic | Known stable CSS selectors, when provided. | No deterministic success recorded. |
| a11y | Playwright accessibility-tree interaction. | Evidence captured. |
| Vision | Screenshot set-of-marks fallback. | Evidence captured. |
| Final Browser State | Browser node outcome. | blocked |

## Browser Layer Trace

- `n:2`: extract attempted -> no useful content extracted -> deterministic skipped/no selectors -> a11y attempted; captured 12 page-state screenshot(s) -> vision attempted; captured 2 screenshot artifact(s) -> final browser state: blocked/interaction_failed (all layers exhausted; last: step cap reached (12))
- Recovery: n:5 recovered n:2 via upstream_failure -> researcher gathered replacement data -> formatter produced final answer

## Final Comparison Table

| Feature | HP Victus | Lenovo LOQ | Apple MacBook Air (M1/M2) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Best For** | Gaming performance | Balanced work & gaming | Productivity & portability |
| **Processor** | Intel Core i5-13420H | Intel Core i5-13450HX | Apple M1/M2 Chip |
| **Graphics** | NVIDIA RTX 4050 | NVIDIA RTX 3050 (6GB) | Integrated GPU |
| **Pros** | Strong gaming power, modern design | Good build quality, 100% sRGB display options | Exceptional battery life, silent operation, premium build |
| **Cons** | Bulky, average battery life | Heavier build | 8GB base RAM limit, not for gaming |

## Final Answer

```text
Here is a comparison of three highly-rated laptops available in India for under ₹80,000, catering to different user needs:

| Feature | HP Victus | Lenovo LOQ | Apple MacBook Air (M1/M2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Gaming performance | Balanced work & gaming | Productivity & portability |
| **Processor** | Intel Core i5-13420H | Intel Core i5-13450HX | Apple M1/M2 Chip |
| **Graphics** | NVIDIA RTX 4050 | NVIDIA RTX 3050 (6GB) | Integrated GPU |
| **Pros** | Strong gaming power, modern design | Good build quality, 100% sRGB display options | Exceptional battery life, silent operation, premium build |
| **Cons** | Bulky, average battery life | Heavier build | 8GB base RAM limit, not for gaming |

**Summary:**
1. **HP Victus:** Ideal if your priority is gaming performance within this budget. It offers a dedicated RTX 4050 GPU but comes with the trade-offs of a heavier chassis and shorter battery life.
2. **Lenovo LOQ:** A versatile choice that balances gaming capabilities with a better display, making it suitable for both content creation and gaming.
3. **Apple MacBook Air:** The gold standard for productivity and travel. It offers industry-leading battery life and build quality, though it is not designed for gaming and the base 8GB RAM may limit heavy professional multitasking.

## Token Usage Capture

Browser a11y/vision turns record per-turn token counts in action/step records. Normal LLM skill calls are tagged with `agent` and `session` and are captured by the gateway ledger exposed at `/v1/cost/by_agent?session=<session-id>`. The session reporter now tries to include that gateway rollup in the cost summary. If the running gateway endpoint returns no rows, the reporter falls back to the local SQLite ledger at `llm_gatewayV9/gateway_v8.db`. If neither source has rows for that session, the summary falls back to node-local cost fields, which are often `0.0` for text skills.

## Orchestrator Constraint

This analysis file is generated through the copied agent's `session_reporter` skill path. The original `S9SharedCode` orchestrator remains untouched.
